# Space Invaders – C++ (Raylib)

A simple Space Invaders–style 2D game built in C++ using Raylib as part of my first semester BSCS project.

## Features
- Player spaceship movement
- Bullet firing system
- Enemy purple demon shapes
- Collision detection
- Score and high score tracking using file I/O

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Raylib
- fstream (for saving high scores)

## Controls
- Left Arrow / Right Arrow – Move player
- Spacebar – Shoot

## How to Run
1. Install Raylib
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler
3. Run the executable

## What I Learned
- Using structs and functions in C++
- Designing a game loop
- Implementing collision detection
- File input/output operations
- Writing modular and organized code

## Future Improvements
- Multiple bullets
- Enemy shooting
- Levels and difficulty scaling
- Sound effects

# Space Invaders – C++ (Raylib)

A simple Space Invaders–style 2D shooting game built in C++ using Raylib as part of my first semester BSCS programming project.

## Features
- Player movement using keyboard input
- Bullet firing system
- Enemy grid movement
- Collision detection
- Score and high score saving using file handling

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Raylib
- fstream (for saving high score)

## Controls
- Left Arrow / Right Arrow – Move player
- Spacebar – Shoot

## How to Run
1. Install Raylib
2. Compile the project using a C++ compiler
3. Run the executable

## What I Learned
- Using structs and functions in C++
- Designing a game loop
- Implementing collision detection
- File input/output operations
- Writing modular and organized code

## Future Improvements
- Multiple bullets
- Enemy shooting
- Levels and difficulty scaling
- Sound effects
